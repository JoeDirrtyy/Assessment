    //question 1


  //declared somethings i know i will use and need - qty, miles, price, product, total
    //form into a static method
    //given qty and price, we need to figure out the total
    // double total = qty * price;
    // we need to figure out delivery fee
    // - create a set of condictions that uses miles to charge customer a fee
    //if(miles <= 4){  -charge them $2
    // fee = $2.00;
    // calculate the total
    // total = total + fee;}
    //else if(miles > 4 && miles <= 15){
    // fee = $5.00;
    //total = total + fee; }
    //else if(miles > 15 && miles <= 25){
    // fee = 10.00
    // total = total + fee;}

    //create a set of conditions that uses the miles to charge a custom fee
    // return the value that will be printed on the receipt



    // need a loop,  need a variable, need objects, an if statement, another class, parameterized constructor, create a method
    // a method becomes the recipe for instructions
    //create a recipe to bake "cake"
    // floud ,  eggs, sugar
}
